Gaze3D Matlab: Tracking 3D Gaze in Radiology
======================
Matlab application developed for the [Gaze3D](http://olwal.com/#tracking_gaze_in_radiology) research projects, a collaboration between Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and MIT Media Lab. 

We collect gaze data from radiologists that search 3D CT scans for lung nodules. Analysis and interactive 3D visualisations of eye tracking data indicate 2 dominant search strategies, where "Drilling" is superior over "Scanning".
